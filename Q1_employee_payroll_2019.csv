"** SPECIAL NOTE:  The following table summarizes wage payments made in calendar year 2019. This is the second report to be issued since twelve collective bargaining agreements, covering approximately 4,400 Port Authority union-represented employees, were successfully renegotiated. It is important to note that the column, “CBA Retroactive Pay,” in the chart below, includes payments made in the first quarter of 2019 based on the retroactive wage increases negotiated as part of these agreements.  At the beginning of 2018, every collective bargaining agreement at the Port Authority had long ago expired. These agreements had been expired for a minimum of six to as many as twelve years. The consequence of this untenable situation was that every one of the approximately 5,400 Port Authority and PATH union-represented workers had not received any annual general wage increase for six to twelve years.  As Port Authority management reported publicly to the Board last Fall, new agreements with all Port Authority unions (except PATH) were successfully reached over the Summer and Fall of 2018. Under the new agreements, each current Port Authority union-represented employee will receive retroactive raises for each year during which their collective bargaining agreement was expired.  For the 2010-2018 period, these retroactive raises averaged approximately 1.9% per year.  In addition, certain unions had been out of contract for more than 8-12 years, extending back to periods prior to 2010. When those unions (whose contracts had expired prior to 2010) entered into new contracts in 2018, the agreement provided for pre-2010 “catch-up” raises consistent with the pattern of raises previously provided to other Port Authority represented employees for the period before 2010.  Accordingly, the Port Authority agreed to pay each employee, in addition to the pay received for their work in 2019, pro-rated lump sum retroactive payments to reflect back pay due under the new agreements. Some of the retroactive payments were paid in the fourth quarter of 2018, some will be paid before the end of 2019, and the remainder will be paid in 2020.  The Port Authority recognizes these wages that are now being paid in lump sum retroactive payments should have been paid to workers during the years when they were due. The Port Authority further recognizes that the delay of up to twelve years in paying employees those general wage increases does not measure up to the standard of just and fair treatment of employees to which the Agency aspires. The new collective bargaining agreements now enable wages and raises to be paid on a timely basis.  In addition, as part of the new agreements, the health care benefit plan for union represented employees has been substantially restructured.  Among other changes, the Port Authority has transitioned from a plan under which employees made no contributions to the cost of their health care coverage, to a plan in which employees will contribute. These changes are expected to result in important reductions in the Port Authority’s annual projected increase in costs for employee health care coverage.  This report is the second to be issued since these union agreements were successfully renegotiated. The portion of retroactive pay for the wages that should have been paid in the past, but are only being paid now, are included in the “CBA Retroactive Pay” column below. These catch up payments should not be viewed as recurring annual payment obligations.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
